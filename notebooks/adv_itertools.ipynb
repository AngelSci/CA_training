    "The module `itertools` is a collection of very powerful—and carefully designed—functions for performing *iterator algebra*.  That is, these permit *function composition* with iterators in sophisticated ways while minimizing concrete instantiation of terms in iterable sequences. In addition to the basic functions in the module itself, the [module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/itertools.html) provides a number of short recipes for additional functions using two or three of the basic module functions in combination. *Be aware that it is easy to get these recipes subtly wrong*. The third-party module `more_itertools` provides additional functions that are likewise designed to avoid common pitfalls and edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic goal of using the building blocks inside `itertools` is to avoid performing computations before they are required, to avoid the memory requirements of large collections, to avoid potentially slow I/O until strictly necessary, and so on. Iterators are lazy sequences rather than realized collections; when combined with functions or recipes in `itertools`, they retain this property.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a quick example of combining a few things. Rather than the stateful `Fibonacci` class to let us keep a running sum, we might simply create a single lazy iterator to generate both the current number and this sum:"

    "The documentation for the `itertools` module contain details on its combinatorial functions as well as a number of short recipes for combining them. Note that for practical purposes, `zip()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `range()` (which is, in a sense, just a terminating `itertools.count()`) could well live in `itertools` if they were not built-ins.  That is, all of those functions lazily generate sequential items (mostly based on existing iterables) without creating a concrete sequence. Built-ins like `all()`, `any()`, `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `functools.reduce()` also act on iterables, but all of them, in the general case, need to exhaust the iterator rather than remain lazy."
