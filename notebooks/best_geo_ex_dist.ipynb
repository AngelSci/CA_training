    "Recall that in the lesson on Refactoring we provided a function `sphere_dist()` to calculate the distances between geographic points.  Of course, the actual Earth is an obloid spheroid whose diameter at the equater is about 0.3% larger at the equator than at the poles.  However, as a simplification for this exercise, we will pretend that the Earth is spherical. Keep in mind, as you design functions and APIs, the possibility of improving the implementation of distance functions later better to match the actual geometery of the planet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a `sphere_distance()` function in our library seems useful.  We would like to build on this function to allow other queries that accept ways of specifying places other than by latitude and longitude, building on the capabilities we explored in GeoPy.  Develop a more general API, with supporting code, documention, and unit tests, to be able to ask other distance questions."

Decide how you wish to handle distances that have endpoints in regions, and document that API (and test the behavior as correct).

The [World Geodetic System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) is a more accurate estimator that gives precision in great arc distances of a few centimeters rather than multiple kilometers of potential error.  If you have completed all the previous work, implement a function `earth_distance()` to substitute for the simplified `sphere_distance()` and let any functions built on top of the latter use the former instead."
