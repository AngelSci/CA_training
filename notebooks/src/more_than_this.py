  by Tim Peters
  (feat Travis Oliphant, Wesley Emeneker & David Mertz)

Beautiful is better than ugly.
++ Immutable is better than mutable.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
++ But, sparse is slower than dense.
++ Data copies should be avoided.
++ Contiguous is better than strided
++ Strided is better than scattered
Readability counts.
++ Reproducibility counts.
++ Composability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
++ But sometimes we only care about the special case.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
++ There are many possible approaches to solving a problem.
[But] there should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
++ Descriptive is better than imperative
++ Array-oriented is often better than object-oriented
++ Vectorized is better than an explicit loop
++ Unless itâ€™s complicated -- then use numexpr, weave, or Cython
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
++ Broadcasting is a great idea -- use where possible
++ Think in higher dimensions
