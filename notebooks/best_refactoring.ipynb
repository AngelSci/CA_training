    "Often, when we sit down to write code, our first pass may work, but not be easy to reuse or generalize. The temptation to just get something that just does the job has a number of downsides:\n",
    "  * it becomes hard to later to understand what the code was meant to do\n",
    "  * when sharing the code, other people will not understand how it works\n",
    "  * other similar problems may require some of the same algorithm, but you don't want to repeatedly re-write the same techniques\n",
    "  * smaller logical pieces lend themselves to testing - if a function only does one thing, we can test that it does that one thing correctly for all valid inputs (see chapter Testing); smaller also functions lend themselves to version control (e.g., git), so that when you change a function, we know immediately what it affects.\n",
    "  \n",
    "How to program is a question of personal style, but only to some extent. Keep in mind that the objective is to minimize the time it takes for someone to come to the code and understand what each piece of it does. That someone may well be you some time in the future."

    "Refactoring is the process of turning code that works as advertised into a better structure that follows the suggestions above. With practice, a programmer will tend to design and write code that better follows style guides and conventions, but in real life, refactoring will always become necessary time to time. The *when* can be roughly described as either if a function has become too complex to easily understand OR some part (not all) of the functionality is required again is a differet context. Remember, repeating yourself means you have multiple oportunities to make mistakes."
