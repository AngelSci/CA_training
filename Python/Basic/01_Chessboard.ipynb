    "*Stories about the invention of chess include a geometric progression problem. The earliest written record of the story is in the Shahnameh, an epic written by the Persian poet Ferdowsi between c. 977 and 1010 CE. In another version, the inventor of chess is Sessa, an ancient Indian Brahmin.*\n",

    "*In the wheat and chessboard problem, the inventor of chess asks his ruler to give him one grain of wheat for the first square on the chessboard on the first day, two grains for the second square on the second day, four grains for the third square on the third day, and so on, always doubling the grains for each square. The ruler laughs at the request, thinking it's a meager prize for a brilliant invention. The court treasurers calculate that an unexpectedly huge number of wheat grains will outstrip the ruler's resources. Stories differ as to whether the inventor became a high-ranking advisorâ€”or was executed for impertinence*\n",

    "Just how audacious was the inventor's request? Let's find out. Then we can discuss whether the smart ass inventor/mathematician deserved a place of honor or execution."
