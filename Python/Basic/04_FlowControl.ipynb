    "In Python code, blocks of code (e.g., within `if`-blocks, `for`-loops, functions, etc.) are distinguished using *whitespace* (tabs or spaces). This [convention was chosen](http://effbot.org/pyfaq/why-does-python-use-indentation-for-grouping-of-statements.htm) against using braces (e.g., in C, Java, etc.) or `BEGIN`-`END` keywords (e.g., in Pascal, Fortran, etc.) or comparable conventions in other programming languages. A *colon* character denotes the start of a block in all cases. All lines within a block should be indented consistently. The end of the code block is recognized as the first line without the same level of indentation. This requires some adjustment for programmers coming from other languages where indentation of code blocks is optional.  However, most code written in other languages is formatted in a similar manner *by convention* to what is mandatory in Python."
