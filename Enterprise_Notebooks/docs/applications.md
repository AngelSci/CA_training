# Applications


### Overview

Applications in a project enable you to easily interact with your files and data.  Applications range from making file uploads easy to running the IPython Notebook to a Workbench.  Applications allow you to customize your Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks experience.

The current set of applications are only the beginning... look for even more to be added soon!

### Running an Application

After you've opened your project, you will find a list of the available applications.  Select the application you want to run from the list and Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks will launch that application in a new tab or window of your browser.  You can run more than one application at a time in your project.
