# You want to use IPython Notebook

### Why Use Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks for IPython Notebooks

The <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target="_blank">IPython Notebook</a> is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks allows you to start using the latest IPython Notebook (v1.1) as soon as you login.

You don't have to worry about installation. Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks already has <a href="http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/index.html" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> installed and an IPython Notebook application that is available to you as soon as you create a free Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks account.

You can add team members to your project so they can see your IPython Notebooks instantly - without any need to email files around. Plus, since Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks runs in the cloud, you and and all your team members can access your IPython Notebooks wherever you have access to a modern browser. You are not tied to a particular laptop or desktop computer, so if you forget your laptop or your hard drive crashes - you still have easy access to all the IPython Notebooks you saved to your Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks account.

Plus, you have access to all the other great features of Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks - home directory, project drive, terminal application, file transfer application, file manager application and more!

### IPython Notebook Application

When you login for the first time to the new Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks, you will see your profile screen.  Your picture is automatically updated with the gravatar associated with the email address you used to setup your Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks account.    You will have a free project that has already been created for you called *my_project*.

To get to the IPython Notebook application, you'll want to navigate to your free project (simply click on *my_project*).  Then, click on the *IPython Notebook* icon on your project home screen.  A new tab or window will open in your browser with the IPython Notebook application running.

It's that simple!

#### What else you may want to check out in Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks

In your project, you can add others as team members.  You'll find this ability in project settings.

You'll definitely want to check out the other applications that are available: File transfer application, Terminal application, File Manager application and more!  You'll find icons to start these on your project home screen.

If your IPython Notebook takes forever to run - you may want to upgrade to a higher performance instance.  This feature is availabe in Project settings. Be aware that for the higher performance instances, you are charged an hourly rate whenever your project is running. A green circle next to your project means it is running, a red circle means it is stopped and no charges will occur.  You can always start or pause your project in Project Settings.

If you need packages that do not come installed by default in Anaconda, you'll want to check out the Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks <a href="anaconda.html">Anaconda documentation</a> on how to create environments and add packages.
