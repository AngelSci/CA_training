# You have a Link to a Shared IPython Notebook

#### What it means when someone shares an IPython Notebook with Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks

When someone shares an IPython Notebook with you through Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks, you can view and run their notebook
successfully without needing to install anything special - regardless of what libraries they used to
create the Notebook.  Typically, when an IPython Notebook is shared in Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks - not only is the Notebook
itself shared with you, but also the python environment in which the Notebook ran.

Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks allows you to clone the shared IPython Notebook into your own Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks account - and then make
whatever changes or modifications you want.  The python environment is also cloned, so you'll be running
in the same environment (unless you change it) as the shared IPython Notebook.
