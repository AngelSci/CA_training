# Workbench Application

### Overview

The Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks Workbench is *Under Construction*.  The Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks Workbench includes a file manager, editor, and terminal.

To open the Workbench Application, click on the Workbench Icon in the Application list on the main page of your project.

When you first open the Workbench, you will see the File Browser on the left hand side and a file transfer application on the right hand side. Opening a file in the editor or a terminal window, will replace the file transfer application on the right hand side.  Once replaced, you'll need to open the file transfer application or another instance of the Workbench from the project home screen in order to use it.

A terminal (bash shell) will open in the right hand panel. You can create additional terminals by either clicking the "Open Terminal" icon again or clicking the plus sign at the top of the terminal window.

To navigate between the terminals created by clicking the plus sign, you'll want to select the number corresponding to the terminal you want to navigate to. To navigate between terminals created by clicking on the "Open Terminal" icon again, you'll select a terminal tab in the upper bar of the Workbench.
