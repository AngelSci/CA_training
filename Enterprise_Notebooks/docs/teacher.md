# You are Teaching a Class

#### How to get to setup Wakari 2.0 for your class

setup a project as "classroom type"

tool to populate the team, chat feature for prof to help students and/or students to help students?

class project has announcements/schedule section on front page - so you will want to put relavant class information for your students to see there. (can only be modified by teacher)

have bulletin board section that teacher or students can post to? i.e. "looking for lab partner, etc."

folder that is read only with class materials, that students could view and copy/clone, but not modify.
(each student would have their own home directory)

perhaps folders for each team member that is r/w only by that team member + teacher. (For submission of completed assignments)
This makes it easy for teacher to run assignment and see results.

#### What other features you'll want to check out in Wakari 2.0

In the upper taskbar, you can select "Users" to see all the currently active Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks users. This lets you see if any of
your students are online.
