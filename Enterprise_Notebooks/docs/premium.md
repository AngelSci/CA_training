# Paid Features

#### There are several premium features of Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks that you can add to your account.

### Additional Projects

Every Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks account comes with a free project.

Any new project you add is charged to your account ($8/month).

### Project Add-ons

#### Project Drive

Shared project drives - teams can easily and securely access a shared file space.

Every new project you create comes with a project drive.  When you setup your new project, you determine the size of the project drive.  At this time, you cannot change the size of the project drive once it is setup - so choose wisely!

The minimum project drive that can be added to your account is 1GB ($2/month).

#### More Powerful Compute Nodes

Access more powerful compute nodes instantly.  Node allocation is fully automated and includes GPU nodes.

By default, your Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks project runs on the Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks free instance.  You have the option to run your project on a larger, more powerful instance.  Prices vary based on the size of the instance you select and are charged by the hour.

You can determine your project instance when you setup your new project. You can change it at anytime in project settings under the Admin tab in the Provisioned Compute Power section. See the <a href="projects.html">Projects  section</a> of the Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks docs for more details.

Since you are charged an hourly charge for the more power compute node for your project, you should make sure to pause your project whenever you are not actively using project resources. No charges accumulate for your project when it is paused.  You can find Project Pause button at the top of the Project tab in Project Settings. See the <a href="projects.html">Projects  section</a> of the Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks docs for more details.
