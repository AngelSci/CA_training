# Terminal Application

### Overview

The Terminal Application is a basic bash shell terminal that opens in a new tab or window in your browser.

You have full access to your home directory and your project drive. You can open multiple shells within one instance of the Terminal Application.  You can also open multiple instances of the Terminal application. So, you can have as many terminal windows open for your Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks project as you want!

To open the Terminal Application, click on the Terminal Icon in the Application list on the main page of your project.

Your shell will start in the project directory.  To navigate to your home directory, type _cd_ followed by the enter or return key. To return to the shared project drive directory, you will need to type *cd /projects/your_username/name_of_your_project* followed by the enter or return key.

To open a new shell within the Terminal, click on the + sign in the upper left corner of the window.  By default you have 1 shell. When you add a second shell, a _2_ appears after the _1_ and the + sign.  When you add a third shell, a _3_ appears after the _2_.  You can open as many new shells within your Terminal instance as you'd like.

If you want to navigate to the third shell, you click on the _3_ in the upper left hand corner of the window.  The color of the number _3_ will change when you navigate to it, alerting you that you are on the third tab.  This applies to all the shells you open within the Terminal application.
