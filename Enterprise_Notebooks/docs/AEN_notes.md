## Creating Projects
1. **Initiate Project Creation** - Click on either the "New Project" button in the project bar or the menu bar.

or

2. **Enter Project Information** - Enter the project name in the create project dialog that appears. The
project defaults to being private. You can change the project to be public at
creation or at a later time.

3. **Project Homepage** - You will then be taken to the homepage for the new project.

4. **Start Project** - Newly created projects are **Stopped** by default in order
to conserve compute resources. To start a project click on the **Projects Settings**
gear icon.

Clicking on this icon will open the project settings page. Click on the **Start** button.
You will need to refresh the page to see the button change from "Starting" to "Pause".
When the button has changed to "Pause" and the project status icon has changed to
a green circle the project has started.

![new_project_create](img/02_h_project_started.png)

If the button changes to "Reset" and the project status icon is a "Yellow Triangle"
then the project has encountered a problem and did not start. Try clicking the
"Reset" button. This will sometimes allow the project to start. If this does not
work contact your administrator.

**Note**: The project status icon also appears next to the project name on the
project homepage and the main Projects page.

**Note**: Launching any of the apps will also start the project.



### Creating New Projects (From Docs)

To create a new project, click on the new project icon on the right hand side of the upper Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks task bar or the _New project_ box on your profile page.

You will be taken to a screen where you can name your project, determine if it will be public or private, and include a summary and description of your project.  The description can be just plain text or you can use markdown syntax and preview what it will look like in the preview tab.
