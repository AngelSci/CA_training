# You are a Student in a Class

#### Where to start

setup a free basic project

verify your teacher added you to the class project

class project will have announcements/schedule section on front page

bulletin board section that teacher or students can post to? i.e. "looking for lab partner, etc."

class project will have folder that is read only with class materials, that can view and copy/clone, but not modify.
(you have your own home directory in your basic project where you can work on assignments)

chat feature

perhaps folders for each team member that is r/w only by that team member + teacher. (For submission of completed assignments)
This makes it easy for the class teacher to run assignment and see results.
