# Team Collaboration

### Project Collaboration

Teams collaborate in Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks via _Projects_. Projects allow a team to be easily combined with the resources, apps, and environments they need to come together and effectively collaborate.

The project owner and team members of a Anaconda Enterprise Notebooks project have:

	- Shared files and home directories
	- Shared Python environment
	- Shared nodes / hardware
	- Common apps
	- Web UI

### Social

You can see all the team members on a project and view the profile of each team member and the projects they have created.

In each project home page, you can see a list of "related projects" that use code libraries and functions similar to the ones used in the current project.
You will only see projects that you have access to, either public projects or ones on which you are a team member.
