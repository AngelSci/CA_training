# Material Development

## Development Goals

Goals the 1st training delivery:

* Identify highest priority topics (Hunt doing this based on client expectations)
* Collect existing materials to support high priority topics
* Get materials into one repo, minimal edits
* Decide what to take on the road
    * decide what to take
    * decide what to give to students, decide what not to give 
    * very limited time before first training trip
    * focus the following efforts on a subset of material
* Verification testing to ensure materials are not broken
* Train the trainer so they know the material well enough to teach it
* Basic pass of copy edits, if time permits

Goals for 2nd training delivery:

* Get additional materials into repo to support all topics on outline
* Test additional materials not taken on last trip or not given to students last time, but needed for next training sessions
* Convert some demos to exercises
* Some minimal copy-editing of material

Goals for Nth training delivery:

* More copy editing, make more professional, consistent style/branding
* Improve narrative text in notebooks/slides
* More student exercises


## Development Planning

For coordinating collection and development of presentation materials for this training, it would be great to have some of the following:

* outline of topics, sub-topics needing to be covered, preferably in terms of tasks/demos.
* description of deliverable: minimal viable product, plus extras, e.g. "would be great if time permits"
* list of needed presentation materials for each topic (jupyter notebooks, sh/py scripts, human scripts, slide stacks, etc)
* templates for presentation materials (template script, template slide stack)
* list of HOWTO documents needed for system/cloud set-up/config to enable presentations (e.g. AWS set-up, shell env config, VM config, etc)
* list of what materials are actually "presentation-ready"

## Raw Material

The official outline of topics that need to be trained to the initial client is maintained here: 

* Check these regularly for updates:
* [WPE Training project docs on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3MLKrmM7TwvWElFRjdpZWVXdW8)
* [Initial Course Outline](https://drive.google.com/a/continuum.io/file/d/0B3MLKrmM7TwvRU1jbURMM041dk0/view)
* [Material Tracker](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_22RUbLgYd8pu4QvteNNYVKY803n56Croy5FLBG76g0/edit)

The outline below is intended to help track what **material** we have actually collected in this repository, whether it is ready to present, and if not, what is needed to get it there.

General Notes on Resources

* need to prioritize the items on this list
* then find links to raw material that could be used to train it
* identify client tasks they need to do
* identify minimum list of topics they need to be trained to do the task

General Notes on Preparations

* have the scripts been tested?
* what host/cloud resource is needed?
* what system/network accounts and config are needed?
* what software install dependencies are needed?
