# Datashare Lesson Plan

## 00, Index notebook

    /Datashader/Datashader.ipynb

    Overview

## 01, The mission of datashader

    /Datashader/notebooks/Datashader_pitfalls.ipynb
    
    Dealing with saturation problems of plotting lots of data
    Datashader uses many OOS Continuum
    Binning uses numba
    Writing your own transfer functions, good to use numba, it's already a dependency
    You can come up with decent solutions,
        but they will always be specific to your
        particular data set, custom one-off each time
        Datashader can do better "out of the box"

##02, Datashader Pipeline

    /Datashader/notebooks/Datashader_pipeline.ipynb

    Datashader raster is all about "tapping in"

    Context, Rendering Engines and limitations:
       * SVG, upto 10^2 pts
       * HTML5 Canvas, used by Bokeh, upto 10^4 pts
       * WebGL, up to 10^6 pts, maybe more but not in Bokeh

    When data is too large to send as single data pts, you want to send an raster (binned) image, not all the data.


    df = pd.DataFrame()
    df.memory_usage
    Good example is to show how using categoricals reduces memory size in a DataFrame

## 03, Taxi Data

    Lesson: Datashader_ex_taxi.ipynb
    Exercise: Datashader_ex_taxi.ipynb
    Solution: Datashader_ex_taxi_soln.ipynb


## 04, BokehGeo and Datashader

    /Datashader/notebooks/Datashader_raster_data.ipynb

    Overlap btw BokehGeo and Datashader, Map transfer functions
    This demonstrates the two
    Using canvas.raster from datashader
    using the transfer functions from bokehgeo (from AWS Repository channel)

## 05, Exercise: Race and Elevation

    /Datashader/notebooks/Datashader_race_elevation.ipynb

    Solution: Datashader_race_elevation_soln.ipynb
    Pulls image from outside into the canvas
    Then use the image data (elevation in this case)
    The elevation data is then brought in as an array, just like a dataframe of points is

    Image pixel values are in units of meters when you bring it in.

## 06, Exercise: Landsat

    /Datashader/notebooks/Datashader_landsat_soln.ipynb
    
    Landsat with numba normalization


## Possible Trouble Spots: Datashader dependencies

* These might not work on Windows:
    * gdal
    * rasterio 

* Datashader
    * Datashader_landsat.ipynb
    * Datashader_raster_data.ipynb
