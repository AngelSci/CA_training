# Set-up the Course Environment

## Terminal

You will need to run commands from the Terminal, using the bash shell

* macOS/OSX: use `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`
* Linux: you already know how

## Set-up Summary

```

conda update conda -y
anaconda config --set sites.aws.url "http://ec2-107-23-5-12.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/api"
anaconda config --set default_site aws

conda env create
source activate iqt

conda install -c sharedpackages accelerate-dldist accelerate-gensim accelerate-skimage -y
conda install -c bcollins bokeh-geo -y

anaconda config --set default_site binstar
conda install -c bokeh datashader=0.3.2
```

## Set-up, Details

If you want to understand each step in the block of commands seen above, read on. We will examine each command before running it to understand its purpose.

### Repository Set-up

Perform additional configuration needed for demonstration of Anaconda Repository, including:

* install latest version of conda
* custom configuration allowing your anaconda client to know the web network address of the AWS host used for this demo.

```
conda update conda -y
anaconda config --set sites.aws.url "http://ec2-107-23-5-12.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/api"
anaconda config --set default_site aws
```

### Baseline environment

The following `conda` command reads the `environment.yml` file and installs all packages listed therein, along with their dependencies (not listed):

```
conda env create
```

### Activating the environment

The following conda command activates the environment, which updates your system `$PATH` to point to specific environment and associated versions of packages under your anaconda environments directory:

```
source activate iqt
```

### Accelerate, Bokeh, and Datashader set-up

Installs additional packages needed for the demonstration of Anaconda Accelerate, including:

* `accelerate-dldist`
* `accelerate-gensim`
* `accelerate-skimage`
* `bokeh-geo`


```
conda install -c sharedpackages accelerate-dldist accelerate-gensim accelerate-skimage -y
conda install -c bcollins bokeh-geo -y
```

## Testing your Set-up

* Launch the Anaconda Navigator and activate the `iqt` environment.
