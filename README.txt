# Welcome to Anaconda Training

## Learning with Anaconda

Anaconda is the leading open data science platform and an ideal environment for interactive, hands-on learning. All training courses offered by Continuum feature interactive curriculum delivered live in an environment built on Anaconda. We use Anaconda to teach Anaconda.

## Set-up

To get set-up for running the interactive course material, start by looking in the `setup/` directory for instructions on how to set up your system for running the course:

```
    setup/SETUP_LINUX_AND_MAC.txt
    setup/SETUP_WINDOWS.txt
```

Open these text files with any text editor or word processor. Follow the instructions there-in. You will use them to install the Anaconda Distribution and create an isolated python environment for use with the course materials. This install and set-up will not interfere with your system python.

## Getting Started

Once you have Anaconda installed and your environment created, launch the course introduction notebook by running the following command in your system shell (Terminal or Command Prompt):

```bash
jupyter notebook Course_Introduction.ipynb
```
