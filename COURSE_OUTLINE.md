# Introduction to Python Programming with Anaconda (3 days)

This is an introduction and overview course intended to present the core python language and the python libraries most relevant to data science and data analytics. Content is presented in the content of and motivated by the most common data analysis tasks.

## Part 1: Environment and Platforms

* Introduction to Anaconda
* Introduction to conda
* Creating & using conda environments
* Updating, exporting, and sharing environments
* Introduction to Jupyter notebooks
* Creating & using Jupyter notebooks
* Python Development workflows: notebooks, shells, & scripts

## Part 2: Programming

* Basic elements (numeric types, strings, variables, operators, objects, methods, binding, reference, type conversion)
* Containers and collections (dicts, lists, tuples, sets, ndarray, Series, DataFrame)
* Data Access (indexing, slicing)
* Flow control (iteration, comprehensions, conditionals, exceptions)
* Functions (scope, signature, docstrings, positional and keyword args, lambda functions)
* Organize and Reuse (functions, classes, and modules)

## Part 3: Data Handling

* Python idioms for working with files
* Overview of common file formats (e.g. CSV, XLS, JSON, SQL, HDF5)
* Distinctions in processing text and binary files
* File operations (open, close, read, write, context managers)
* Strategies for data storage on disk, storage in containers
* Preview of Pandas, using pandas file read methods
* Identifying & normalizing redundant data in tabular formats
* Chunked data reads, writes, and processing
* Python-specific files (pickle, npz, and npy files)

## Part 4: Data Visualization

Fundamentals of Matplotlib and Bokeh

* Introduction to Matplotlib for data visualization
* Matplotlib in context: bokeh, seaborn, latex, pdf, eps, %magics
* Basic line plots and figure formatting
* Pylab interface versus object interface
* 2D line plots, scatter plots
* Statistics plots (hist, pdf, cdf, box, whisker)
* Contour plots, Heat-maps, and 3D visuals
* Presentation (subplots, color maps, styles, file formats, latex)
* Introduction to Bokeh
* Bokeh Charts and Plotting

## Part 5: Numeric Data & Computation

Fundamentals of Numpy for Fast Computation

* Distinctions between numpy arrays & lists in Python 
* numpy dtype array attributes and their associated metadata
* Common numpy constructors: ones, zeros, empty, eye, diag, etc.
* Attributes of numpy arrays: dtype, ndim, shape, etc.)
* Common numpy methods (e.g., all, any, unique, where, etc.)
* Importing data files directly into numpy arrays
* Constructing numpy recarray objects for tables of heterogeneous records
* Building arrays in blocks (e.g., concatenate, split, stack)
* Slicing & indexing numpy arrays
* Boolean & fancy indexing
* Broadcasting, vectorization, & universal functions

## Part 6: Mixed Data & Analysis Workflows

Fundamentals of Pandas for data analysis workflows

* Overview of Pandas capabilities
* Pandas for reading and writing data, reprise
* Pandas data structures: Series, DataFrame, Panel, Index
* Indexing and Slicing
* Use of .loc[] indexing
* Use of dictionary-style indexing
* Fancy and Boolean indexing
* Setting and resetting an index
* Multi-level indexing using pd.IndexSlice
* Hierarchical indexing and MultiIndex
* Aligning data by index value
* Groupby and reshaping data
* Pivot tables
* Time-series analysis
* Resampling, groupby, and data frequency
* Merge and join operations
* Finding and filling in missing data
* Statistical characterization of data sets
* Visualization: Pandas with Matplotlib and Bokeh
