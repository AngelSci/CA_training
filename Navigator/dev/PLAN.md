## Lesson Notes

Exercises are very simply demonstrations, with "solutions" inlined. But they provide good practice for the students using the Navigator interface and workflow.

## Installing Navigator

It should be installed when you install Anaconda, but if not, use conda:

```bash
conda install anaconda-client
```

Launch the navigator from the Bash shell:

```bash
which anaconda-client
anaconda-client
```
